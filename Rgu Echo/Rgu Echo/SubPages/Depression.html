                    <h1>Depression</h1>
                    <p>
                        We all have times when our mood is low, when we feel sad or that we can’t be bothered.  During these times, 
                        we often find that we have less interest in things than usual or enjoy things less than we usually would. 
                         In many cases, we are able to identify a reason or reasons for these feelings and they pass either on their own or as the situation(s) causing the feelings resolve.  
                         At other times, there is no obvious situation or triggering event for feeling this way.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Sometimes these feelings get so bad that they interfere with a person’s daily life, 
                        making it difficult to do things like getting out of bed, washing or leaving the house.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Depression is a clinical term for experiencing these sorts of feelings in a pervading way and over a prolonged period.  
                        The duration of symptoms and the severity of the feelings and their impact on a person’s daily functioning can vary.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you are concerned that the person is thinking about death or suicide then you should ask them specifically about this if you feel able to.  
                        People often worry that asking about suicidal thoughts will ‘put the idea into the person’s head’, however the opposite is true… 
                        if a person is not thinking about suicide then asking them about it will not make them start considering this as an option.  
                        If a person is thinking about suicide then they often feel like this is not something they can discuss with others due to the taboo nature of the topic, 
                        but you asking them about it can make it feel safe to discuss and can allow the person to share how they feel rather than struggling with this alone.

                    <h1>Recognising a Problem</h1>
                    <p>
                        Recognising problems with depression involves identifying persistent feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and 
                        a loss of interest or pleasure in activities that used to bring joy. 
                        Here are signs that might indicate an issue with depression:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Persistent Sadness: Feeling sad, empty, or tearful most of the day, nearly every day.</li>
                        <li>Loss of Interest: Losing interest in activities or hobbies that were once enjoyable.</li>
                        <li>Changes in Appetite or Weight: Significant changes in appetite or weight, either a decrease or increase.</li>
                        <li>Sleep Disturbances: Difficulty falling asleep, staying asleep, or sleeping excessively.</li>
                        <li>Fatigue or Loss of Energy: Feeling consistently tired, physically drained, or lacking energy.</li>
                        <li>Feelings of Worthlessness or Guilt: Having persistent feelings of worthlessness, guilt, or self-blame.</li>
                        <li>Difficulty Concentrating: Finding it hard to concentrate, make decisions, or remember things.</li>
                        <li>Recurrent Thoughts of Death or Suicidal Ideation: Thinking about death, dying, or having thoughts about suicide.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        It's important to note that experiencing one or two of these symptoms doesn’t necessarily mean you're clinically depressed. 
                        However, if these symptoms persist over an extended period, typically lasting for more than two weeks, 
                        and significantly affect your daily life, you might find it useful to seek professional help. 
                        Consulting with a mental health professional or healthcare provider can lead to proper diagnosis and treatment options, which might include therapy, medication, or a combination of both. 
                        Additionally, self-care practices such as regular exercise, maintaining a healthy diet, practicing mindfulness, 
                        and seeking social support can also be beneficial in managing symptoms of depression.

                    <p>
                        Most people will experience feeling low for a few days from time to time and 
                        we have recommended some options that could be useful. 
                        But if it is lingering and these aren't helping, talking to a professional like a 
                        GP or private therapist  may help.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Try to stick to regular eating and sleeping patterns as much as possible</li>
                        <li>Try to engage in regular daily routines (e.g. getting out of bed, getting washed and dressed, brushing teeth, going outside)</li>
                        <li>Try to engage with activities or interests that you used to enjoy</li>
                        <li>Try to cut down or avoid alcohol and other drug use as these can contribute to depressive feelings</li>
                        <li>Speak with someone that you trust about how you are feeling</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        If you are concerned that you may be in immediate danger of harming yourself or 
                        killing yourself contact the emergency services or one of the crisis 
                        lines detailed on the right hand side of this page.
