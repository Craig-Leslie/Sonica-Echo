                    <p>
                        The phrase ‘self-harm’ is used to describe a wide range of behaviours. Self-harm is often understood to be a physical response to an emotional pain of some kind, and can be very addictive.
                        Everyone has accidents from time to time resulting in cuts and bruises - but it's the injuries that are caused on purpose that are considered to be acts of self-harm. 
                        Self-harm often happens during times of anger, distress, fear, worry, depression or low self-esteem in order to manage or control negative feelings. Self-harm can also be used as a form of self-punishment for something someone has done, 
                        thinks they have done, are told by someone else that they have done, or that they have allowed to be done to themselves.

                    <p>
                        People sometimes ask if what they are doing to themselves can be classified as self-harm. The bottom line is that anything that causes you harm – even slight harm – 
                        which in some small way makes you feel better emotionally, can fall under the umbrella of self-harm. The important thing isn’t to focus too much on the labeling, 
                        but to recognise when help is needed and find some support as soon as possible.
                        Sometimes, self-harm    is referred to as self-injury. It doesn’t matter which term you use, providing you feel you are being heard and understood.

                        <li>try calming breathing exercises or other things you find relaxing to reduce feelings of anxiety write down your feelings – if you can, share these with someone you trust</li>
