            <button class="dropdown-button">“My issues are nothing to do with my studies; why would I ask for help at the University?”</button>
            <div class="dropdown-content">
                <p>You might see your personal life and studies as separate. Sometimes problems in our personal life can impact on our ability to study. If we can help you with those problems and help you to have more awareness of what you are facing, you can use that knowledge for your whole life, including your studies. </p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="myth-dropdown">
            <button class="dropdown-button">“Others will see me going into the counselling service and know I am struggling.”</button>

                <p>
                    We want you to feel safe and comfortable when attending and leaving wellbeing and counselling appointments. The waiting area of the service is shared with several other services: Study Skills, Student Help Point, Visa & Immigration service, Student Finance or those that simply want to use the computers. 
                    If you are uncomfortable meeting face to face, we offer wellbeing & counselling appointments by Teams, Zoom, telephone, email or chat.

            <button class="dropdown-button">“It’s not about my studies; can I still get support?”</button>
            <div class="dropdown-content">
                <p>We support you with anything that is getting in the way of you having a good University experience if it is important to you, we will take you seriously. </p>

            <button class="dropdown-button">“I’m from a culture where we just don’t talk about these kind of things”</button>
            <div class="dropdown-content">
                <p>
                    We are aware that you may not reach out for many reasons, including cultural or society norms and expectations.
                    You may just need a compassionate ear to help navigate decisions you are making or issues you are having.
                    It might be daunting to begin to acknowledge that ‘I am not feeling ok’ or ‘I can no longer do this the way I have been doing it’. We can help you find a way forward in safe confidential space.

            <div class="dropdown-content">
                <p>While demand can vary, the counseling team prioritizes urgent cases and works to minimize wait times. Many students are seen within a short time frame after requesting an appointment.</p>

            <button class="dropdown-button">“It's hard to access these services from off campus.”</button>
            <div class="dropdown-content">
                <p>We have a range of wellbeing and counselling appointments: daytime and evening by Teams, Zoom, telephone, email or chat, so we can meet you wherever you are in a way that suits you.</p>

        <div class="myth-dropdown">
            <button class="dropdown-button">“I don’t want to commit to 6 sessions.”</button>

                <p>

                    We offer an initial wellbeing appointment where you can ask further questions and discuss your hopes and concerns about counselling. You can continue to see the Wellbeing Advisor, or if you are happy to do so, be referred to counselling. You can then meet a counsellor (the same one) up to 4 sessions at busy times and 6 sessions at less busy times.
                    You can use as many or as few sessions as you need. You can come for one and see how it goes, and if that feels enough for you and you get what you need you don't have to use the rest. You and the counsellor will talk about this as you go along.
